		<p>My name is Shihmin Chen. After graduating with an undergraduate degree in New York, I moved back to Asia and started a job as an Overseas Planner for an import/export company in Japan, which was where I spent 2/3 of my career.  I spent the latter third of my career working for tech companies in Taiwan in market research and sales roles.  I am taking classes in digital media because I have always been interested in high technology and digital productions; also, I am in the best place to be to learn this discipline since the Bay Area has one of the strongest network for digital media.</p>
		<p>Now that I am taking this web and app development class because I have become even more interested developing the app that I designed for my own project.</p>
